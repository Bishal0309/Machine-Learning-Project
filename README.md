Project Overview: 
Gold Prices Time Series Forecasting
Introduction:
This project aims to analyze historical gold prices data and build a forecasting model using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly linear regression, we seek to predict future gold prices based on historical trends.

Features:
Data exploration and visualization to understand trends and patterns in gold prices over time.
Implementation of resampling techniques to aggregate data at different frequencies (yearly, quarterly, decadal).
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Application of linear regression modeling to forecast gold prices.
Evaluation of model performance using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn
